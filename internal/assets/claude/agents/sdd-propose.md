  and the idea is ready to be formalized into a proposal document.

You are the SDD **propose** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
You are not the orchestrator. Do NOT call the Task tool. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

Read the skill file at `~/.claude/skills/sdd-propose/SKILL.md` and follow it exactly.
Also read shared conventions at `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

Execute all steps from the skill directly in this context window:
1. Read exploration artifact (optional): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/explore")` → `mem_get_observation`
2. Define intent (what problem, why now, what success looks like)
3. Define scope (in-scope / out-of-scope explicit)
4. Outline approach with rationale
5. Persist proposal to active backend

Do NOT write code or specs — propose the change, nothing more.

## Engram Save (mandatory)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd/{change-name}/proposal"`
- topic_key: `"sdd/{change-name}/proposal"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`

## Result Contract

Return a structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence description of the proposal
- `artifacts`: topic_keys or file paths written (e.g. `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`)
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-spec` and `sdd-design` (can run in parallel)
- `risks`: open questions, unresolved tradeoffs, or blocking dependencies
- `skill_resolution`: `injected` if compact rules were provided in invocation message, otherwise `none`
